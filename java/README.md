Java files for the Raspberry Pi 
===============================

These are files which accompany the "Thinking Small" article.

*mqttdemo* contains files used as examples in the article itself, plus an extended version of the main example which generates a test message when a button is pressed.

*javatempread* is an additional example which can be used to replace the Beaglebone Python code with a Raspberry Pi Java program which reads the temperature from as DS18B20 1wire sensor.
